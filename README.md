K-means clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that partitions data into k pre-defined clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and cluster centroids.  Itâ€™s ideal for exploratory analysis due to its simplicity, scalability, and lack of need for prior data knowledge.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are probabilistic models that represent data as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions, each with its own mean and variance.  GMMs are widely used for clustering and density estimation, offering a way to model complex data distributions through simpler Gaussian components.
